Student-Data-Analysing-Tool

This Project uses Object Oriented Programing in C++ to read files, parse data, sort student information etc.
To use this software, follow the steps:
download all files to your local machine and move them under a single folder in the location of your choice, you may want to keep the .txt file you want to analyse in a different location (recommended) 
If you see a .exe file after downloading all files on your local machine, you can skip the next step.
now open the .dev file, compile and run it on your local machine, to install it in your local machine. after this you will see a .exe file in your folder.
Now open command prompt and change directory to the folder containing the program, in the command prompt write down <name>.exe <address of the .txt file on your local machine>
write the 'name' and the 'address' as per whatever it's showing on your local machine (don't include '<>' it's just for the sake of showing that the name and address can be user and/or machine dependent)
on pressing enter on the cmd you'll see the output inside the terminal itself.
This project doesn't support GUI yet but is fully capable to upgrade, and incorporate a GUI instead, if you feel there can be improvement in this, do let me know in the discussion section.
happy coding :)
